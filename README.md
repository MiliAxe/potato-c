# Potato-c 
Potato-c is a no BS pomodoro timer for GNU/Linux operating systems.

## The Pomodoro method
This method is about breaking your tasks into small intervals so you don't get zoned out from not having enough tik tok videos.

## Why potato-c
This program's base idea is from [Tomato.C](https://github.com/gabrielzschmitz/Tomato.C), "a pure C pomodoro timer",
which after trying to fork it, the ideas behind it seemed problematic to me.  
This program tries to be able to run on a potato (as the name suggests)
- Blazingly Fast and efficient
- Is modular and simple
- It is based on POSIX Philosophy, does one thing and one thing only.

## Usage
Refer to man pages for full documentation. If I do a documentation in here, I will likely forget to update it.
Just after installation, use the commands below to read the docs.
